# Opalstack Terraform Provider

This is a Terraform provider for the [Opalstack hosting](https://www.opalstack.com/) api.

## Swagger Codegen

The API client itself is built using Swagger Codegen from the [OpenAPI documentation](https://my.opalstack.com/api/v1/doc/).

To regenerate the client run the following:

```bash
rm -rf swagger/
mkdir swagger/
cd swagger/
swagger-codegen generate -i https://my.opalstack.com/api/v1/schema/ -l go
```

As of version 3.0.30, `swagger/model_ip_address_type_enum.go` generates invalid Golang enums due to starting with an integer. You need to modify that by prepending a `v`. I [reported this upstream](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/11615)

Also, JSON object types need to be converted to either `interface{}` or some other format depending on the documentation. I used `string` in some cases that just looked like key/value pairs.

`swagger/model_application_response_json.go` needs to be modified to be all pointers so that we are able to capture unset state.

## API Mapping Notes

I tried to keep as close as possible to the terminology and semantics of the API.

I skipped the app "failed" and "installed" endpoints. They seem to be useful for running a script which installs application code after the app itself is installed. I can't think of any way this makes sense with Terraform. If you think of one, let me know.

Resource, mail, and schema endpoints aren't implemented. The former two only return access denied errors for me, and the latter one doesn't make sense in this context.

I'm skipping quarantinedmail because I'm not sure how to validate that I did it right, and I don't see a use with Terraform. File a ticket if you have a use case for this.
